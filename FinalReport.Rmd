# Predicting the Unpredictable: Should You Really Be Worried about the Big One?

Earthquakes are one of the most unpredictable natural disasters that occur in the western United States. As statisticians who also study geology and geography, we decided to tackle the challenge of making predictions about earthquakes. We're both from cities that have been tormented by a variety of media sources warning of the impending "Big One" (Los Angeles, California and Tacoma, Washington). Just take a peek at this 2015 article heading from *The New Yorker*:

Scary, right? Pretty much the entire west coast was on high alert for a couple years, holding city-wide earthquake drills and demanding everyone take the time to nail their bookshelves to the walls. While the hype has since died down a little, we wanted to dive deeper into earthquake predictions. Although the Big One was rumored to possibly exceed a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter Scale, we defined quakes of magnitude 7+ to be "big" for the sake of having enough data. The first question you might have is: how likely are we to see an earthquake this big in the next year? What about in the next five? We hope to approach an answer to these questions using Bayesian statistical modeling and regression.

# The Data
We collected all of our data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. For predicting magnitude, we gathered 4700 observations of earthquakes above a magnitude of 4.5 since the year 2000. For our yearly rate predictions, we have 88 observations of earthquakes above a magnitude of 7 since 1900.

### Preliminary Exploration
To get acquainted with the data, we created maps to get a sense for where the earthquakes in our data set were occurring. Using the ggmap package, we were able to use our latitude and longitude data to plot the earthquakes directly on base maps pulled from Google Maps. Each set of maps shows all earthquakes in the top two maps and only large earthquakes in the bottom two. First, we have earthquakes by their magnitudes:

Next, we plotted by year:

\

The trends in these maps gave us a few ideas for our analysis. What if we started with a simpler model relating magnitude to geographic region, then moved into a more complex model to estimate the yearly rate of earthquakes? These models would certainly be of significance to those living in earthquake-prone areas. We can use Bayesian regression and modeling techniques to make predictions about the relationships among our variables of interest.

# Predicting magnitude

### The Model

To start off simple, something that may be helpful or interesting to know is how big you can expect the next earthquake to be. Many small earthquakes happen daily in Alaska and on the west coast of the US, where we will focus our analysis. For this reason, we chose to make predictions about earthquakes that people are likely to actually feel.

\
Our data set consists of all magnitude 4.5+ earthquakes in North America from 2000-2017. We added a column to the data that specifies the broad region in which each quake occurred: Alaska, Canada, Hawaii, Mexico, or US. Below are some boxplots we used to explore the relationship between region and magnitude, where magnitude is log-transformed to account for expected skew:

\

From these plots, there appear to be small differences in median magnitudes and in variation by region. Okay, we know — there's nothing especially fascinating going on here, but it's worth an exploration. We can construct a model that we believe captures some of the observed trends. If we let $M_i$ represent the magnitude of earthquake $i$ and $X_i$ be the region in which earthquake $i$ occurred, then we can obtain the following model and priors:

\

$$\log(M_i)|\beta_0, \beta_1, \tau_0, \tau_1 \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_{1i}X_i, (\tau_0 + \tau_{1i}X_i)^{-1})$$
$$\beta_0, \beta_1 \sim N(0, 100^2)$$
$$\tau_0 \sim N(10,100^2)$$
$$\tau_1 \sim N(0, 100^2)$$

\

According to this model, we assume that log(magnitude) is Normally distributed. We allow each region its own error term to account for the differences in variation we saw in the boxplots. Our prior understanding of the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \tau_0$ and $\tau_1$ is vague — we assign an uninformative mean and arbitrarily large variance to each.

### Analysis & Results 

Now that we have a model set up, we can start getting into the meat of the prediction process: estimating the parameters that will lead to our prediction distribution! We begin by using the rjags package to fit our model. Since $X_i$ is a categorical variable, we set Alaska as a reference group and estimate $\beta_{1i}$ and $\tau_{1i}$ as differences from the reference. We want to run enough simulations of sample posteriors that the posterior mean values of the parameters stabilize. After a few trials, we use a running mean plot function from the MacBayes package to determine that 50,000 iterations of the algorithm would suffice. Below is a sample running mean plot for the posterior value of $\beta_0$:

\

Once we are comfortable with our simulations, we can take a look at the posterior distributions of our parameters. First, we see the plots for $\beta_0$ and each $\beta_{1i}$:

\

The $\beta_0$ distribution tells us we can expect a base magnitude of about $e^{1.585}$, which is about 4.88 (our model predicts log(magnitude), remember). Each of the $\beta_{1}$ plots represents the change in magnitude prediction from the base for a given region. The regions are in alphabetical order so that the reference (beta1[1]) is Alaska, followed by Canada, Hawaii, Mexico, and the US (beta1[2], beta1[3], beta1[4], and beta1[5], respectively). Apart from the reference, each $\beta_1$ plot is centered somewhere slightly above 0. This indicates that all regions are expected to have higher magnitude earthquakes than Alaska, on average. This does indeed match the trend we saw in the boxplots, where Alaska's median expected magnitude was the lowest. Depending on how much you know about Alaska, this may be surprising — Alaska has experienced some of the largest earthquakes on record. But Alaska also experiences some of the most *frequent* earthquakes, many of which are not so large. Thus, it's likely that these results are reflective of a relatively small percentage of large earthquakes compared to moderate ones.

\

Next, we see the plots for the error parameters, $\tau_0$ and $\tau_1$:

\

Created random sample from the distribution we created. In the end, we found that we would expect the next moderate and above earthquake to be about a 4.96 magnitude.


# Predicting yearly rate

### The Model

Another important study to conduct is figuring out the yearly rate of large earthquakes (above 7 magnitude). To do this we created a poisson model where the rate lambda is based on the longitude range and year of interest. We then got a yearly rate of earthquakes for each longtitude range.
